/*
    SH7709S unified cache - simple-dual-port (1R1W) banks, parallel-way, SINGLE CLOCK.

    Geometry: 16 kB, 4-way, 16-byte lines, 256 sets (see SH7709S.PDF pp.103-104).

    Two-beat lookup pipeline (one architectural cycle per beat, both overlapped so
    hits are back-to-back, IPC 1):

      beat 0 (request cycle): the pipe presents the live AGU address; the ACCEPT
        (req_ready) is decided from registered state + the PREVIOUS access's live
        resolve (z_ok below). At the edge the RAMs capture the read index and
        bram_* captures the request descriptor (acc_*_q capture the accept).
      beat 1 (resolve cycle): tag/data q are compared against bram_*; a HIT is
        answered COMBINATIONALLY (rsp_valid off the resolve) and consumed by the
        pipe at the closing edge - the same edge the NEXT access is captured.
        A MISS dispatches into the serialising FSM at that closing edge.

    The dclk half-clock speculative registers (do_*, resq stale-pair machinery,
    the 4-rail late-select) are DELETED: with one edge there is no held response
    slot - the resolve IS the response. Loss-free holding: a live hit response
    that the pipe cannot consume this cycle RETIRES into the registered rsp_*
    flags (held until consumed), so no response is ever overwritten.

    ACCEPT vs DISPATCH: an access Z accepted at edge E dispatches (on a miss) at
    edge E+1 - the same edge a new access A wants acceptance. z_ok blocks A
    whenever Z's resolve occupies the cache (any state-leaving transition, a
    registered-response post, or a CCR flush request). This is the single
    global-stall term; it carries the tag compare into req_ready by design.

    Back-to-back stores: a write-back store hit commits its strobed bytes at the
    resolve edge; the NEXT access's read captures at that same edge, so the
    write-through bypass registers inside cache_mem supply the just-written
    bytes (write-before-read order restored; see cache_mem.sv).

    Miss / external bus FSM: unchanged from the dclk design - each state lasts a
    full cycle and its RAM read lands one state later (the read-address capture
    at a state's closing edge presents that state's address). The only addition:
    a memory-mapped dispatch (S_MMTAG/S_MMDATA) redirects the read-address
    capture at the dispatch edge so the state's first cycle reads cur_*, keeping
    the dclk cycle counts.

    Replacement: 6-bit pseudo-LRU, Table 5.2 (cache_pkg). Write policy
    (pp.105,110-111): per-region mode (P1->CCR.CB, P0/U0/P3->~CCR.WT, wb_mode);
    U (dirty) bit in the tag entry; write hit WB=cache+U / WT=cache+memory;
    write miss WB=write-allocate / WT=memory only; read/inst miss fills.
    Write-back buffer (1 line, p.111-112, Fig 5.5). Memory-mapped cache windows
    (p.112-114): tag 0xF0xx_xxxx, data 0xF1xx_xxxx.
