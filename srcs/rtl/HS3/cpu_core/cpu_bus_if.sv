/*
    CPU memory bus interfaces.

    LBus is the unified pipeline<->cache channel (the SH7709S "L bus" of the
    block diagram). Once the time-shared AGU drives one address per cycle - an
    IF instruction fetch OR an MA data access - the separate IBus/DBus collapse
    onto this single bus, selected by req_fetch. LBus carries three sub-buses:

        - address + control : master -> slave  (the shared AGU address)
        - write data  (M2S) : master -> slave  (store payload; inert on a fetch)
        - read data   (S2M) : slave -> master  (load word / fetched line word)

    SINGLE-CLOCK model: every wire below is a plain scalar evaluated inside one
    architectural cycle. A hit response is COMBINATIONAL off the cache resolve
    (RAM q read the previous edge) and is consumed the same cycle; miss/bypass
    completions arrive on the registered rsp_* flags. The former dual-CEN 4-rail
    late-select machinery (rl_*, late_*) is deleted - the rails were Shannon
    covers for half-cycle-late selects that no longer exist.

    IBus_1 is the SH7709S "I bus 1" (Fig 1.1, hw manual p.6): the cache is the
    single master; the splitter routes to the BRIDGE (I bus 2 registers) or the
    BSC leg (external memory). Plain ready/valid; plain stores are posted.
